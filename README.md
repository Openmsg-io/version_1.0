# Openmsg: The spam free, open messaging protocol
Openmsg was built as an alternative to email by someone who was fed up of spam. It is an open, cross-platform, decentralized messaging protocol that anyone can implement. All you need is a domain name and a database. Developers can build their own clients and servers in any programming language.


# Key Features
# Spam-free
The Openmsg protocol is designed from the ground up to be spam-free. One user cannot message another without explicit permission. For example, if user A wants to contact user B, they need to know not only user B's Openmsg address but also possess a one-time passcode that was issued by user B. Without a valid passcode, any connection attempt will silently fail—user B won’t even be notified. That means: no spam messages, no spam requests, no noise.

# Open Protocol
Openmsg is an open protocol — anyone is free to implement it. While most examples on this site use PHP and MySQL for simplicity, the protocol itself is platform-independent and can be implemented in any programming language of your choice.

# Decentralized
The protocol is fully decentralized — there’s no central server or authority. Anyone with a domain name and a database can run their own instance, giving them complete control over their messaging system while still being able to communicate with others using the same protocol.

# Encryption Built-in
A key feature of the protocol is built-in end-to-end encryption. When two users first connect, they securely exchange both encryption keys and authorization keys for ongoing communication.
Authorization keys verify permission to exchange messages between the users.
Encryption keys ensure that all messages are encrypted end-to-end, keeping content private.
Each message is accompanied by a unique hash generated by the sender, based on the message content and timestamp. This allows the recipient’s server to verify that the message is authentic and recent. Once a message hash has been used, it cannot be reused, preventing replay attacks.

# Easy to Implement
Setting up a server is simple—all you need is a database and a few files. You can setup the protocol on any domain in just a few steps:
Set up the database tables (we provide PHP code to create the necessary tables in just a few clicks)
Download the PHP files and upload to your server
Tweak the configuration to match your server settings.

If you're not using PHP, the provided code can be used as a reference and easily adapted to any programming language.
